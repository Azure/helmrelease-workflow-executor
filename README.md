# orkestra-workflow-executor

Azure Orkestra's default workflow executor

## Functionality

The default executor is responsible for deploying the `HelmRelease` object passed in as an input parameter to the docker container. The `HelmRelease` is represented by a `base64` encoded YAML string. The executor deploys, watches and polls for the status of the deployed `HelmRelease` until it either succeeds/fails or it times out. The timeout interval is configurable with the default set to 5m.

## CLI options

```shell
  $ make build
  $ ./bin/executor --help
